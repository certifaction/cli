# Certifaction Digital Twin

You can secure your printed documents with a [Digital Twin](https://certifaction.com/digital-twin/).
Digital Twins connect printed documents to their digital originals.
In this way, you can download the securely stored digital copy to your device, verify its authenticity,
and eliminate any document fraud risks.

How the Digital Twin works:

1.  Before the signature, a unique and secure URL is created and added to the document with a QR code.
2.  The document is encrypted.
3.  The encrypted copy is stored in Certifaction Digital Archive (DA).
4.  The Digital Twin URL is recorded in Certifaction document locator.
