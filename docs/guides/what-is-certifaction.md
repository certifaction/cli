## End-to-end encryption

We process your PDF documents locally instead of sending them to a central server outside of your control.
When we need to store documents, we always encrypt them client side before sending them to us.
If you need to share document references, you can always protect them with a cryptographically strong
password.

## Legally valid identity check

Certifaction supports several signature levels from the standard electronic signature (SES) to the
qualified electronic signature (QES). In addition, Certifaction offers the professional
electronic signature ([PES](https://certifaction.com/professional-electronic-signature-pes/)),
which combines an instant ID-check with a convenient simple signature.

Digital Twins connect printed documents to their digital originals.
In this way, you can download the securely stored digital copy to your device, verify its authenticity,
