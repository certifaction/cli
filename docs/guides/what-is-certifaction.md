## End-to-end encryption

We process your PDF documents locally instead of sending them to a central server outside of your control.
When we need to store documents, we always encrypt them client side before sending them to us.
If you need to share document references, you can always protect them with a cryptographically strong
password.

## Legally valid identity check

Certifaction supports several signature levels from the standard electronic signature (SES) or the advanced electronic signature (AES) to the qualified electronic signature (QES).

## Verifiable signatures for printed documents

You can secure your printed documents with a [Digital Twin](https://certifaction.com/digital-twin/).
Digital Twins connect printed documents to their digital originals.
In this way, you can download the securely stored digital copy to your device, verify its authenticity,
and eliminate any document fraud risks.
