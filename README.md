# Certifaction CLI

This is the [Certifaction](https://certifaction.com) CLI repository with the documentation and the
executables for different platform.

Direclty jump to the [Installation](#installation) section to install the CLI
for your platform.

Please create an [Issue](https://github.com/certifaction/cli/issues) to report any bug and propose new features.

**Notes**: Certifaction CLI is being developped in a fast pace and this
documentation will already contain upcoming features not yet available in the
most recent public release.  Those features will be flag with the **[Upcoming
Feature]** notation.

## Introduction
[Certifaction](https://certifaction.com) is the electronic signature technology for the Internet. With our
blockchain solution, we empower people and companies to sign and verify
documents in total privacy at any time, at any scale.  By integrating with our
straightforward API and tools, any business can provide the right level of
security and compliance to their processes and products.

This document
describes the Certifaction command line interface (CLI) , which provides a
command line interface and an HTTP server that can be used by third party
applications to sign and verify documents while preserving the documentsâ€™
confidentiality.

## Requirements

The CLI is distributed as an executable file compatible with recent Linux,
Windows and macOS operating systems and can be run in a Docker container.

The CLI requires access to Certifaction API and an authentication token for most
of its commands.

When using the CLI as an HTTP server,  the executable will listen to HTTP ports
which must be accessible to client applications.

## Principles
The Certifaction CLI can be used in two modes:
* Interactive to execute commands
on the shell, as part of a script or from a third party application.
* Server
mode that exposes HTTP endpoints.


In both cases, the CLI sits between the third party application and Certifaction
API and will handle document signing, verification and revocation without
leaking the document content outside the controlled IT infrastructure of the
client.

The two main functions of the CLI are document signature and verification.

### Document signature

During document signature, the CLI will:
1. Receive the PDF
document to sign and process it (add security features and the signature
footer).
2. The processed document is returned and must replace the initial
document (as this will be the document that will be signed).
3. The hash of the
file and a public key is sent to the Certifaction API for registration.
4. The
signature is timestamped in Ethereum.
5. The signature is stored encrypted in a
public database.

![Document signagure diagram](./assets/document-signature-diagram.svg)


### Document verification

During verification, the CLl will calculate the document hash and extract the
private signature decryption key, then call Certifaction API that will find any
signature timestamp in the blockchain and return the encrypted signatures.

1. The document to verify is provided to the CLI
2. The document hash is sent to the Certifaction API
3. The verification Certifaction API will search Ethereum for all the signature timestamps for the given hash and return them.
4. The timestamps refers to encrypted signatures stored in content addressable storage (CAS).
5. Certifaction API returns the encrypted signature to the CLI since it cannot decrypt them without the private signature decryption key contained only in the document.
6. The signatures are decrypted and a verification result is returned.

## Usage options

In addition to being a useful command line utility, the CLI can be used by
standalone applications to sign documents with Certifaction without having to
integrate external libraries by calling the command line CLI to either process
documents stored in a directory or using the standard input/output.  The CLI can
also be deployed as an HTTP server container on client datacenter or cloud in
order to integrate existing document workflow with Certifaction without ever
exposing documents to the outside world.

### Standalone application integration

In this scenario, the standalone application will use the OS command execution
available to their platform to run the Certifaction commands.  The documents can
either be saved and loaded on the file system, or they can be passed to the
command using the standard input and output.

![Standalone application diagram](./assets/standalone-application-diagram.svg)


### Running the HTTP server on a node [Upcoming Feature]
In this scenario, the Certifaction CLI is started in server mode, either
directly in a node or VM, or inside a Docker container.  The client will use
HTTP to sign and verify documents with the guarantee that documents do not leave
the client IT system.  This is the best option for centralized document
signature where documents are signed during an automated document workflow.

![HTTP server mode diagram](./assets/http-server-mode-diagram.svg)

## Authentication

Document signature, revocation and getting user information require authentication.
The authentication is done by passing an authentication token or an API key:

* Access tokens can be issued by you or by an external OIDC provider.  Either case, Certifaction will have to register the identity provider.
* API keys are managed from Certifaction web application.  They can only be used for server side API integration.
* For HIN Sign authentication, please follow the instructions in https://download.hin.ch/documentation/oAuth2_Dokumentation_de.pdf

## Installation
The CLI is delivered as an executable compatible with most of the usual
platform and can be found in the [Release](https://github.com/certifaction/cli/releases) 
section of this repository.

Simply download the file for your platform and install it.

Please create an [Issue](https://github.com/certifaction/cli/issues) if you do
not find an executable with your platform.

### General usage
This is the mode when the CLI is started using the `certifaction server` command
as following:

```
certifaction server [server flags]
```

The CLI will start an HTTP server at the configured port and listen to the following endpoints:

```
GET /docs        Return the API documentation
GET /health      Return the health of the Certifaction API
GET /ping        Ping the Certifaction API
POST /prepare    Prepare a document for signing
POST /sign       Sign a document
POST /verify     Verify a document
POST /revoke     Revoke a document
POST /request    Request a document signature
GET /user        Return the authenticated user information
```

The endpoints directly mirror the CLI commands.

### Authentication
When indicated, the requests must be authenticated using the Authorization header as following:

```
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
```

If the request is not authenticated, the client will be redirected to a login page.

### TLS connection
The server does not terminate TLS connections. If TLS is required, a proxy must be placed before the server.

### Common response code

```
400 Bad Request             Client error
401 Unauthorized            The request is not authenticated
403 Forbidden               The request is authenticated but the
                            client is not authorized
500 Internal Server Error   An unexpected server error occurred
503 Service Unavailable     Temporary service unavailability
```
