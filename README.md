## Introduction

[Certifaction](https://certifaction.com) is the electronic signature technology for the Internet. With our solution,
we empower people and companies to sign and verify
documents in total privacy at any time, at any scale. By integrating with our
straightforward API and tools, any business can provide the right level of
security and compliance to their processes and products.

This document
describes the Certifaction command line interface (CLI) , which provides a
command line interface and an HTTP server that can be used by third party
applications to sign and verify documents while preserving the documentsâ€™
confidentiality.

## Requirements

The CLI is distributed as an executable file compatible with recent Linux,
Windows and macOS operating systems and can be run in a Docker container.

The CLI requires access to the Certifaction API and an authentication token for most
of its commands.

When using the CLI as an HTTP server, the executable will listen to HTTP ports
which must be accessible to client applications.

## Functionality

The CLI provides three main functionalities for your documents:

*   Digital signatures
*   Certification
*   Verification

The certification and verification functionality is detailed in the [Blockchain certification](blockchain_certification.md) page.
The rest of this document will focus on the document digital signature.

## Document signature

Certifaction digital signature allows client to add one or more digital signatures to PDF documents.

Client can also invite other people to sign documents by providing them with secure document URLs
containing a secret key.  The secret key will decrypt the document before signing, ensuring that
Certifaction never access the document in clear text.

Certifaction document signature is based on the [PAdES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAdES) standard,
which uses cryptography and the public PKI infrastructure to provides the highest guarantee against forgery.

Certifaction uses three signature levels with increasing identity verification assurances:

*   Standard Electronic Signature (SES): email verification
*   Professional Electronic Signature (PES): identification using ID document scanning and verification
*   Qualified Electronic Signature (QES): Swiss and EU qualified electronic signature requirements

Certifaction unique privacy-first signature ensures that document content does not leave your
IT infrastructure in clear text without your consent.

### Simple document signature

Here are the steps during a simple document signature:

1.  The CLI Receives the PDF
    document to sign and process it (add security features including a unique secure URL and one or more signature
    pages).
2.  The hash of the
    file is sent to Certifaction API for signature
3.  Certifaction API uses one of its pluggable signature provider depending on the signature level and jurisdiction
4.  Certifaction API returns the PKCS #7 CMS signature to the CLI
5.  The CLI embeds the signature in the PDF document and returns to the Client

Additional signatures can be appended to an already signed document sequentially.  Sending a signed document to an
other signer is a simple and valid option.

### Document Digital Twin

In addition to storing the secure URL inside the PDF as custom information.  A Digital Twin QR code can be added
to the document.  This QR code contains the secure URL that can be used to retrieve the encrypted version of
document stored in Certifaction servers.

When printing the document, the visible QR code can be scanned to retrieve the last version of the document.
Certifaction Digital Twin bridges the world of printed and digital documents.

Here are the steps to store an encrypted version of the document and return a Digital Twin URL:

1.  Before signature, a unique and secure URL created and added to the document with a QR code
2.  The document is encrypted
3.  The encrypted copy is stored in Certifaction Digital Archive (DA)
4.  The Digital Twin URL is recorded in Certifaction document locator

![Document digital twin diagram](./assets/document-digital-twin-diagram.svg)

### Document signature request

Certifaction document signature request rely on the Certifaction Digital Archive to store end-to-end encrypted
document.

During a signature request, the CLI will:

1.  Receive the PDF
    document to sign and the signer information
2.  Processe the document, adding security features including the secure Digital Twin URL
3.  Encrypt the document using the secret key contained in the Digital Twin URL
4.  Store the document in Certifaction Digital Archive for later retrieval.
5.  Return the secure URL

The Digital Twin URL can be shared with the invited person.  A new URL must be created for each signer.
Since the URL contains a secret, access to its content must be protected as well as would be the original document.

## Usage options

The Certifaction CLI can be used in two modes:

*   Interactive to execute commands
    on the shell, as part of a script or from a third party application.
*   Server
    mode that exposes HTTP endpoints.

In both cases, the CLI sits between the third party application and the Certifaction
API and will handle document signing, certification, verification and revocation without
leaking the document content outside the controlled IT infrastructure of the
client.

![Principles diagram](./assets/principles-diagram.svg)

In addition to being a useful command line utility, the CLI can be used by
standalone applications to sign and certify documents with Certifaction without having to
integrate and link to external libraries.

An application can call the CLI to either process
documents stored in a directory or using the standard input/output. The CLI can
also be deployed as an HTTP server container in the client's datacenter or cloud in
order to integrate existing document workflows with Certifaction without ever
exposing documents to the outside world.

### Standalone application integration

In this scenario, the standalone application will use the OS command execution
available to their platform to run the Certifaction commands. The documents can
either be saved and loaded on the file system, or they can be passed to the
command using the standard input and output.

![Standalone application diagram](./assets/standalone-application-diagram.svg)

### Running the HTTP server on a node

In this scenario, the Certifaction CLI is started in server mode, either
directly in a node or VM, or inside a Docker container. The client will use
HTTP to sign and verify documents with the guarantee that documents do not leave
the client IT system. This is the best option for centralized document
signature where documents are signed during an automated document workflow.

## Authentication

Document signature, revocation and getting user information require authentication.
The authentication is done by passing an authentication token or an API key:

*   Access tokens can be issued by you or by an external OIDC provider.  Either case, Certifaction will have to register the identity provider.
*   API keys are managed from the Certifaction web application.  They can only be used for server side API integration.
*   For HIN Sign authentication, please follow the instructions:
    *   [German](https://download.hin.ch/documentation/oAuth2_Dokumentation_de.pdf)
    *   [French](https://download.hin.ch/documentation/oAuth2_Dokumentation_fr.pdf)

## Proxy settings
The CLI integrates with Certifaction API using HTTPS. If the deployment is behind a proxy you must configure the proxy using an environment variable.

The proxy can be configured by setting the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` (or the lowercase versions thereof).
HTTPS_PROXY takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for https requests.

The environment values may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]", in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.
The schemes "http", "https", and "socks5" are supported. An error is returned if the value is a different form.

## Installation

The CLI is delivered as an executable compatible with most of the usual
platforms and can be found in the [Release](https://github.com/certifaction/cli/releases)
section of this repository.

Simply download the file for your platform and install it.

Please create an [Issue](https://github.com/certifaction/cli/issues) if you do
not find an executable for your platform.

### General usage

This is the mode when the CLI is started using the `certifaction server` command
as following:

    certifaction server [server flags]

The CLI will start an HTTP server at the configured port and listen to the following endpoints:

    GET  /health          Returns the health of the Certifaction API
    GET  /ping            Pings the Certifaction API
    POST /prepare         Prepares a document for signing
    POST /sign            Signs a document
    POST /retract         Retracts a document
    POST /download        Downloads and decrypts a document from the digital archive
    POST /delete-access   Removes Certifaction access to the file
    POST /request/create  Requests a document signature
    POST /request/edit    Edits a signature request
    POST /request/cancel  Cancels a signature request
    POST /request/cancel/all  Cancels signing of the document
    POST /request/list        Lists signature requests for a document
    GET  /user            Returns the authenticated user information
    POST /qes/check       Checks whether the current user is QES enabled
    GET  /docs            Returns the API documentation [Upcoming feature]

The endpoints directly mirror the CLI commands.

### Authentication

When indicated, the requests must be authenticated using the Authorization header as following:

    Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>

If the request is not authenticated a HTTP 401 Unauthorized response is returned.

### TLS connection

The server does not terminate TLS connections. If TLS is required, a proxy must be placed before the server.

### Common response code

    400 Bad Request             Client error
    401 Unauthorized            The request is not authenticated
    403 Forbidden               The request is authenticated but the
